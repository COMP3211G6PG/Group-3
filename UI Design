UI design 

User Interface (UI) design is a discipline of design that focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a product or technology. It involves designing the points of interaction between users and digital products, such as websites, apps, or software1. Here are some key points about UI design:

Visual Elements: UI design involves creating and arranging visual elements on a user interface, such as buttons, icons, and images. The goal is to make interfaces visually appealing and easy to navigate1.
Interaction Design: UI design also involves creating intuitive and efficient ways for users to interact with a product. This includes designing interactive elements such as buttons and forms, as well as gestures for touch and voice-controlled interfaces1.
Consistency: Consistency in UI design means ensuring the design and interactive elements are uniform throughout the product. This helps users understand how to use the product more quickly2.
Hierarchy: Hierarchy in UI design helps guide users’ eyes to the most important elements first. This can be achieved through the use of size, color, and placement2.
Feedback: Good UI design provides feedback to users about their actions. This could be in the form of visual cues, such as highlighting a button when it’s clicked, or providing error messages when something goes wrong2.
